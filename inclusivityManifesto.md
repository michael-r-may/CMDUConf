#Inclusivity Manifesto

Apart from refering to other documents regarding inclusivity I'd like to put it in my own words (as much as a risk as this might be).

Please be nice.
Please be wellcoming.
Please respect other people.
Please think in the others first.

All speakers, organizers and attendants must respect this rules. To wrap up I'd like to use a quote.

> Your freedom ends where others start

Please know, if by the use of your free will you traspas on another person's respect by action or inaction you will be expeled from the conference and legal actions will be taken.

If you still need some more concret rules, we collected some:
[Atom Code of conduct](http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/2/0/)
